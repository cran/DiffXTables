Version 0.1.3

  2021-05-14
  1. Updated user manuals, README, DESCRIPTION, and the vignette.
  
  2021-04-28
  1. Added the citation to the Bioinformatics paper describing 
     Sharma-Song test with observed null table marginals in 
     DESCRIPTION, CITATION, REFERENCES.bib, and README.md files. 
  2. Introduced a boolean parameter to compensate the issue of Cochran's
     condition of samples value less than 5 in any cell.
  
  2020-12-24
  1. Updated DESCRIPTION
  2. Introduced null.table.marginal parameter to use the
     sharma.song.test with observed and uniform marginal null
     population.
  
  3. No longer using the correction of normalized frequency table A
     inside function get.e.mat()
  4. Added test cases for the uniform marginal null tables.
  5. Added test cases for parameter compensated parameter.
  6. Updated the user manual for sharma.song.test() function.
  7. Added full citation information and DOI number for the 
     first-order marginal change test ACM paper (Sharma et al, 2020)
     in DESCRIPTION, CITATION, REFERENCES.bib, and README.md files.
  8. stats::chisq.test() is no longer called inside function
     chisq.test.stat(). This reduce the overhead in chisq.test(), as we
     only need to compute the Pearson chi-squared test statistic.

  2020-08-07
  1. Updated DESCRIPTION
  2. Updated REFERENCES.bib and CITATION
  
  2020-08-02
  1. Updated user manual for type.analysis() function
  2. Turned off Yates correction in calculating 2x2 chi-squared
     statistics in internal R function chisq.test.stat
  3. Adjusted test cases for 2x2 tables used for the heterogeneity 
     test without Yates correction. See line 270 and 272 in 
     test_DiffXTables.R
  4. Removed duplicate function chisq.test.stat() and created a new
     file chisq-test-stat.R to include only one copy of the function.
  5. Changed the package title to "Pattern Analysis Across Contingency Tables"
  
  2020-08-01
  1. Renamed association.order.ana() to type.analysis()
  2. Included a S3 method print.DiffXTableTypeAnalysis()
  3. Updated the printout of type.analysis()
  
  2020-07-22
  1. Added a marginal.change.test for first-order analysis.
  2. Added a strength.test for determining the strength of
     association.
  3. Added a association.order.ana method for analysis of strength
     and change in association.
  4. Added test cases for all the methods. 

  2020-05-14
  1. Corrected the normalized frequency table A inside 
     function get.e.mat() in Sharma-Song.R when an entry 
     has both zero row and zero column sums.
  2. Add new test cases for the above change.
  
  2020-05-02
  1. Created version 0.1.1 from 0.1.0
  
Version 0.1.0 

  2020-03-19
  1. Changed the return value of the simulator function 
     SimulateDiffXTab().
  2. Renamed the simulator function to simulate_diff_tables() from
     SimulateDiffXTab().
  3. Minor editing in various files to improve code readability.
  4. More tests are added for the simulator function.
  5. Corrected typos in the vignette.

  2020-03-18
  1. Created version 0.1.0
  2. Removed unnecessary calculation of the rank of covariance of
     matrix C, which is theoretically known. Thus the import of Matrix
     package is removed.
  3. Revised function manuals.
  4. Changed the simulator function arguments.
