Description: Statistical hypothesis testing of pattern heterogeneity
    via differences in underlying distributions across multiple
    contingency tables. Five tests are included: the comparative
    chi-squared test (Song et al. 2014) <doi:10.1093/nar/gku086>
    (Zhang et al. 2015) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv358>, the Sharma-Song
    test, the heterogeneity test, the marginal-change test (Sharma et
    al. 2020), and the strength test (Sharma et al. 2020). Under the
    null hypothesis that row and column variables are statistically
    independent and joint distributions are equal, their test
    statistics all follow an asymptotically chi-squared distribution.
    A comprehensive type analysis categorizes the relation among the
    contingency tables into type null, 0, 1, and 2 (Sharma et al.
    2020). They can identify heterogeneous patterns that differ in
    either the first order (marginal) or the second order (joint
    distribution deviation from product of marginals). Second-order
    differences may reveal more fundamental changes than first-order
    differences across heterogeneous patterns.
